# DMR comparison
This section will perform downstream analysis after DMR identification -- find the overlapping DMRs. In order to easily edit/test scripts and uplode/downlode files (< 1-2 Gb), [Open OnDemand](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Open_OnDemand) (a web interface to starting and attaching to HiPerGator jobs) is used. Thanks for the help from Matt!
