# Calculate methylation rate
The output files of bismark were used
## 1. Genome-wide methylation rate
Script `Genome_wide_methylation_rate_V1.ipynb` was used, which is modified from [here](https://github.com/niederhuth/Widespread-natural-variation-of-DNA-methylation-within-angiosperms/blob/c9966e4e9df6d37649c3923509874bce0dd3ad80/mC_pyTools.py#L31); the results are consistent with the reprot from bismark!
