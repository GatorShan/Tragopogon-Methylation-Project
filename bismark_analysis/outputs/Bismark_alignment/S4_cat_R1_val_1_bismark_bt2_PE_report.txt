Bismark report for: /orange/soltis/shan158538/Methylation_output/trim_galore/S4_cat_R1_val_1.fq.gz and /orange/soltis/shan158538/Methylation_output/trim_galore/S4_cat_R2_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.22.3)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /orange/soltis/shan158538/Methylation_output/bismark_genome_prep/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	743190004
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	238997030
Mapping efficiency:	32.2% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	457246896
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	46946078
