Bismark report for: /orange/soltis/shan158538/Methylation_output/trim_galore/S5_cat_R1_val_1.fq.gz and /orange/soltis/shan158538/Methylation_output/trim_galore/S5_cat_R2_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.22.3)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /orange/soltis/shan158538/Methylation_output/bismark_lambda_genome_prep/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	474830346
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	1307191
Mapping efficiency:	0.3% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	473523155
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	0
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	3998

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	697790	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	605403	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
