# SNP Calling
The T. pratensis (2x) genome sequencing reads are mapped to the reference genome of T. dubius (2x) -- SNPs between the two species are then identified.

## 1. Mapping
### 1.1 Mapping T. pratensis reads to T. dubius reference genome using BWA
Script `BWA_indexing_V1.sh` was used to index the reference genome. Script `BWA_mapping_V1.sh` was used for mapping.
