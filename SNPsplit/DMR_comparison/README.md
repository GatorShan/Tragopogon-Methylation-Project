# DMR comparison
This section will perform downstream analysis after DMR identification -- find the overlapping DMRs. In order to easily edit/test scripts and uplode/downlode files (< 1-2 Gb), [Open OnDemand](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Open_OnDemand) (a web interface to starting and attaching to HiPerGator jobs) is used. Thanks for the help from Matt!

Script `Overlap_DMR_V1.py` was used for following analyses.

## 1. DMR comparision -- between parents vs between subgenomes

| Overlaping DMR with different direction of change | 44 |
| DMR identified only between two parents | 9,703 |
| DMR identified only between two subgenomes | 1,035 |
